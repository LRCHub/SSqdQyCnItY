Ten boxes of medecine
Remember the two numbers
Let dry
They buried
Now fight
Rises are growing in the window

I record old building bills
Riding blind
Through the screen
You are bound
To disappear
And gamble

How was your only day?
I once loved you better
Beautiful in May
How was your only day?

Simmer out
Over tickle
