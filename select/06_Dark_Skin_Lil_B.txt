Whats real, lemme tell you about some
Things that i've seen
Real life let me tell you
About somethings that i did
Definition of a real nigga, it's just words
Like tattoos it don't mean shit
Ride the bus devilish thoughts
My peoples possessed
Resort to violence as the proper choices
(yea) everytime i walk in the room
I'm getting stared at i evened glared back
It's ending like death threats
Proud to be from my city, but loosing respect
Don't nobody give a fuck about the blacks
Real shit
Even blacks even killing off blacks
Blame it on slavery, but it's the presidents
Fact your losing grip
They say it's not so bad, why do i complain
Can't drive a dunger or scraper
Without getting pulled over
Gotta tie your dreads back
Not to scare people had to soften my voice
The courts think I'm evil
I could write 10 books
I can't even wear a hoodie
Without getting funny looks like I'm bummy
Like I'm a joke shit, but nothing funny
I love life, and i love people
But society done showed me
All this black on black violence
Everyones is not my homie
And most days I'm spending lonely
Living life as a artist
And don't matter where u work
Work can be a target
If you love in your heart
No matter where you started
Dead broke a couple years you could be ballin
It starts from you, change starts from you
Supposed to be a leader, just breathe a
Emphysema we need more black leaders
You could be a street soldier
You could be a poet just give
The world what you owe it i believe in you
