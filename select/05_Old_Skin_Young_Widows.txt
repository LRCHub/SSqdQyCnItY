She healed you with her fingernails
She healed you with her teeth
You can feel her cut through you late at night
You can tell you're getting old
She can tell you're getting old

Old skin
Old skin
Old skin
Old skin

She healed you with her fragile words
She healed you with her voice
You can hear her move through you late at night
You can tell you're getting old
She can tell you're getting old

Old skin
Old skin
Old skin
Old skin

She sings to you late at night
